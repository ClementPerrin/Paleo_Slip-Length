These three Matlab速 programs are designed to find the best set of consecutive earthquakes that fits a distribution of L (horizontal distance, in km) and D (cumulative offsets, in m) measurements along a fault. Measurement weights are stored in W. The programs work as follows :

- fit_rand_tri.m generates a random set of Nt triangles ;
- N_fit_rand_tri.m runs the previous program Nr times and outputs the set of triangles that achieves the best weighted rms among them ;
- M_N_fit_rand_tri runs the previous program Nl times and outputs the set of triangles averaged from the Nl best triangles.

You need to run only the M_N_fit_rand_tri.m program, the two other programs being called from within this program. You may however run the two other programs independently.

The Auxiliary folder contains 4 small Matlab速 functions needed by the main three programs (aboveLine.m, create_weights.m, dist2triangle.m, weight_rms.m) and 2 Matlab速 functions that can be used before (merge_dataset.m) and after (stat_triangles.m) the main three programs. The first one merges two datasets of different quality factors. The second one computes mean and standard deviation of triangles geometries.

VERY IMPORTANT :

These programs rely on several functions contained in the very useful matGeom toolbox, written by David Legland

This toolbox and the Auxiliary folder must obviously be on your Matlab速 path.
